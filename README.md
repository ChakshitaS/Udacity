# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
The dataset represents Bank marketing campaign of a bank. The data indicates the potential customer likely for the deposit of the bank represented by the column ("y").We use Classification method to determine the result.

We will use two machine learning experiments, with primary metric as "Accuracy".

1) Scikit-learn  with Logistic Regression Classifier, Script Run config as an estimator using the Sklearn env and hyperdrive run for hyperparameter tuning.

i2) AutoML experiment by selection of classification task and their hyper parameters.

Best models selected under each of the pipelines are as follows:

i) Scikit-learn: Logistic Regression model with 90.08% Accuracy and with parameter values: C: uniform(0.05, 2), max_iter:  choice(range(10,200,20)).

ii) Azure AutoML: VotingEnsemble classifier with 91.679 % Accuracy.
Hence Azure Automl is the best experiment to run to achieve maximum accuracy.

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
